FISCAL YEAR\n\nThe Association has a fiscal year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.\n\nE. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents for the statement of cash flows include amounts in checking accounts.\n\nF. ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of \nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial \nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual \nresults could differ from those estimates.\n\nG. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nSubsequent events were evaluated through September 25, 2014, which is the date the financial \nstatements were available to be issued.\n\nNOTE 3 -- FUTURE MAJOR REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS\n\nAlthough not specifically required in by-laws, industry practice is to establish reserves over a \nnumber of years to fund major repairs and replacement of Common Area components.  Accumulated \nfunds for major repairs and replacements should be accounted for in separate certificates of deposit and \nsavings accounts and generally are not available for expenditures for normal operations.",

The Board has also not developed a plan to fund those needs.  When \nreplacement funds are needed to meet future needs for major repairs and replacements, the Association \nhas the right to increase regular assessments, pass special assessments, or delay major repairs and \nreplacements until funds are available.  The effect on future assessments has not been determined at this; \nhowever, the effect could be material.\n\nNOTE 4 -- INCOME TAXES\n\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require the Association \nmanagement to evaluate tax positions taken by the Association and recognize a tax liability (or asset) if \nthe Association has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon \nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service. Management has analyzed the tax positions taken by the \nAssociation, and has concluded that as of December 31, 2013, there are no uncertain positions taken or \nexpected to be taken that would require recognition as a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the financial \nstatements. The Association is subject to routine examinations by taxing authorities; however, there are \ncurrently no examinations for any tax periods in progress. Management believes it is no longer subject to \nincome tax examinations for years prior to 2010.\n\n\n\n8\n\nTHE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION FOR CHANDLER CREEK, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT.)\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2013\n\nNOTE 4 -- INCOME TAXES (CONT.)",

It rates insurance companies with respect to their overall \n\nperformance in managing the company for policyholders and investors, and it categorizes \n\ncompanies according to their financial size. Companies given an A or A+ rating have \n\ndemonstrated a continuing ability to underwrite risks competently, control costs, make wise \n\ninvestments, and absorb catastrophic losses. \n\n \n\nThe financial size category is determined by the surplus to policyholders, reserves, and \n\ncapital of the company. \n\n \n\nWe have listed below the Best's ratings for each of the proposed carriers for your insurance \n\nprogram. We feel it is important that you are confident in the quality and strength of the \n\ninsurers protecting your asset. \n \n\n \nINSURANCE \n\n COMPANY  \n\nPOLICYHOLDER \n\n  RATING  \nFINANCIAL \n\nSIZE RATING \n\nWesco Insurance Company A- XV \n\nHudson Excess Insurance Co.

Portions of Highpointe are located in areas with sensitive \nenvironmental features. Accordingly, there are limitations, including impervious cover \nrestrictions, on development activity in the subdivision. The recorded plats for the subdivision \nare accessible at the following link: https://hayscad.com/subdivisionplats/sublisth/. The plats \ncontain information about setbacks, greenbelt lots, and use restrictions. The plats should be \nreviewed along with the recorded governing documents for Highpointe. \n\nUse of Adjacent Lots. As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review. With few exceptions, improvements must be approved by the Association \nin writing before work commences. When in doubt, please inquire by contacting the Association. \nIt is NOT better to ask for forgiveness then permission where approval is concerned.

Portions of Highpointe are located in areas with sensitive \nenvironmental features. Accordingly, there are limitations, including impervious cover \nrestrictions, on development activity in the subdivision. The recorded plats for the subdivision \nare accessible at the following link: https://hayscad.com/subdivisionplats/sublisth/. The plats \ncontain information about setbacks, greenbelt lots, and use restrictions. The plats should be \nreviewed along with the recorded governing documents for Highpointe. \n\nUse of Adjacent Lots. As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review. With few exceptions, improvements must be approved by the Association \nin writing before work commences. When in doubt, please inquire by contacting the Association. \nIt is NOT better to ask for forgiveness then permission where approval is concerned.

As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review.

Accordingly, there are limitations, including impervious cover \nrestrictions, on development activity in the subdivision.

The plats \ncontain information about setbacks, greenbelt lots, and use restrictions. The plats should be \nreviewed along with the recorded governing documents for Highpointe. \n\nUse of Adjacent Lots. As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review. With few exceptions, improvements must be approved by the Association \nin writing before work commences. When in doubt, please inquire by contacting the Association. \nIt is NOT better to ask for forgiveness then permission where approval is concerned. The \ngoverning documents, including the Design Guidelines, contain additional rules pertaining to \nuse of the greenbelt and open space lots, as well as the Highpointe trail system. \n\nDefinitions \n\n\"Common Area\" means any property and facilities that the Association owns or in which it",

Some guards have left because of \nthis treatment and some security personnel are choosing not to work here because of some \nresidents behavior.  \n \nIn the event of abuse of the guards by a resident, the POA Board has taken the following \nactions : \n \n\n1. The new RFID Agreement requires a signature for purchasers of RFID tags. It states: \n \n\nRequires a Resident, Resident\u2019s family, and invitees and/or contractors to at all times \ntreat the security personnel hired by the POA and all representatives of the POA in a \ncourteous and respectful manner. Failure to do so shall result in disabling of the \nRFID tag without notice.\u201d \n\n \n2. The Rules & Regulations of The Hills of Lakeway Property Owners\u2019 Association, Inc. \n\nare being amended to include the following: \n \n\n\u201cResidents, members, guests or contractors that are verbally abusive to The Hills \nSecurity Officers [and POA representatives (revision to be made to R&R)] are \nsubject to loss of RFID privileges for 30 days.  If repeated violations are observed, all \nRFID privileges will be suspended indefinitely. Loss of RFID gate access requires \nthose vehicles to enter at manned gates only and does not deny access to the \ncommunity.\u201d",

Therefore, it cannot guarantee its ability to perform the required repairs or replacements to those major components for which the Association is obligated.\n\u00b7 Since the TxR - Reserve Study includes measurements and cost estimates of the client\u2019s components, the detail reports may be used to evaluate the accuracy and price of contractor bids when components are due to be repaired or replaced.\n\u00b7 The TxR - Reserve Study is an annual disclosure to the membership concerning the financial condition of the association, and may be used as a \u201cconsumers\u2019 guide\u201d by prospective owners. \n\u00b7 Your TxR - Texas Reserves Report provides a record of the time, cost, and quantities of past reserve replacements.

Because it is calculated using the current annual assessment, it will give the accurate projection of how well the association is funded for the next 30 years of planned reserve expenditures.\nThe Hills of Lakeway POA\n\nThe Hills of Lakeway POA\n\nTexas Reserves \u2022(361) 894-6558 PAGE 2-1\nTexas Reserves \u2022(361) 894-6558 PAGE 2-1\nTexas Reserves \u2022(361) 894-6558 PAGE 2-1\nResponsibility for Maintenance\nThe Board of Directors is responsible to ensure that the Association component assets are inspected on a regular schedule as recommended by manufacturers or installers, or as dictated by conditions.  Good management dictates that a regular inspection be performed for the Association property with an eye on changing conditions that may require maintenance or a change in the maintenance plan.\nNote:  The Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing the draft reserve report and all assumptions and listed Common Element Components.\nIncluded Components and Comments\nAdditions \u2013 Reserve funds are only to be used for the long term repair, replacement and restoration of existing common elements.",

This indicates a relatively strong reserve fund position.  In order to continue to strengthen the account fund, we suggest adopting reserve contribution increases of 2% annually to cover the rate of inflation. If the contributions fall and the reserve fund is below 70% percent funded level, then the reserve fund may fall into a situation where special assessments, deferred maintenance, and lower property values are likely at some point in the future.  \nMeasures of strength are as follows:\n0% - 30% Funded is considered to be a \u201cweak or poor\u201d financial position.  Associations that fall into this category are subject to special assessments and deferred maintenance, which could lead to lower property values.  If the association is in this position, actions should be taken to improve the financial strength of the reserve fund.  \n31% - 69% Funded is considered a \u201cfair to good\u201d position.  The majority of associations fall into this category.",

This plan is calculated in which a minimum annual contribution \n\nis sought with the constraint that the ending reserve balance or percentage for each year (1 through 30) must be greater than \n\nor equal to a specified dollar or percent funded amount.  The calculation takes into consideration only the immediate total \n\nannual expense requirements. Due to this fact, annual allocations may fluctuate widely from year to year. This plan provides a \n\nminimal contingency for unanticipated emergency expenditures. Baseline Funding is a form of Threshold Funding where the \n\nminimum balance is $1.00 for the duration of the report.\n\n- \n\nTarget Funding: A funding model designed to achieve a specific goal (percentage) over a projected time frame.  Example of a \n\ntypical target funding model would be \u201cTarget Funding \u2013 100% in 10 Years\u201d.  This example is designed to achieve the fully \n\nfunded mark of 100% in year 10. Once the target is hit, the model will then adjust to maintain this level of funding for the \n\nremaining years of the report. The target and designated time frame can be adjusted to meet specific requirements of a \n\nproperty.\n\n- \n\nFull Funding: A full funding model is designed to achieve and maintain a funding goal near or at 100%. This model can be \n\ncalculated by designating a specific time frame to hit the 100% funded level (see Target Funding).\n\n- \n\nLadder Funding: A funding plan designed to incorporate varying funding percent increases or dollar amounts to meet specific \n\nfunding goals or expense requirements.

First things first. Whether you are evaluating the need to increase your reserve \n\ncontributions or leaving them the same, everybody wants to know \u2013 \u201cwhere is the money going ?\u201d Typically, 3 to 5 categories make \n\nup 80 % to 90 % of the anticipated expenditures.Review the Executive Summary and Component Inventory to understand what you \n\nown.\n\nStep Two (2): Review Your Upcoming Anticipated Expenditures. It\u2019s important to evaluate what projects are expected for repair, \n\nrefurbishment, and/or replacement within the next 3 to 5 years. Review the Anticipated Expenditures report and if you don\u2019t agree \n\nor don\u2019t plan to complete those improvements, make sure your component inventory is adjusted accordingly.\n\nStep Three (3): Analyze Your Current Funding Plan. Always look to see if your Current Funding Plan is solvent. In other words, are \n\nyou going to run out of money? Look to see if your current reserve contributions meet your anticipated expenditures over the life of \n\nthe plan? If yes, great! If not, look at the year the ending reserve balance goes negative (the plan runs out of money), see what the \n\nanticipated expenditures driving the shortfall are, and make adjustments accordingly.\n\nStep Four (4): Adopt a Funding Plan that Meets Your Needs. We believe it\u2019s important to give you options. That\u2019s why we designed \n\nthe Summary of Funding Plans for you to review. We show you what you are currently contributing to reserves, and let you",

These changes aim to ensure that our neighborhood remains a desirable place to live, maintaining \nboth its aesthetics and property values. As most of you are aware, the CCR\u2019s are the tools used by your HOA Board \nto govern the use of a property in a community, and maintain consistency in property appearance, construction, \nmaintenance, etc. These rules exist to protect property values and maintain consistency in the community. CC&Rs \ncan include rules about, among other things: \n\n\u2022 Fences \n\u2022 Garbage cans Business openings\n\u2022 Maintaining animals, livestock, etc.\n\u2022 Unsightly or abandoned vehicles, trailers, etc., and\n\u2022 New construction of homes or improvements.\n\nBy updating the CCRs, the Board is given the tools necessary to preserve the integrity of La Ventana Ranch, \nprotecting property values and ensuring the long-term appeal of our neighborhood. These changes will help avoid \nsituations where neglected properties or unapproved modifications negatively impact surrounding homes. Our CCRs \nhave been in existence for many years and can be viewed on the website of PS Property Management, our new \nproperty management company. More information on these more global amendments will be forthcoming next year. \nIn the meantime, there is one amendment that will be necessary on a more urgent basis to address unclear language \nwithin the CCR\u2019s which may inadvertently allow Airbnb and Vrbo vacation home rentals to exist within the La Ventana \ncommunity.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

SWL uses Professional \nGeneral Management Services, Inc. (PGMS) as its water facility manager for the operating and \nadministrative services. Both SWL and PGMS are owned by the same individual\u2014Patric King. \nWe are not practicably able to change water companies.  \n\nWho Controls How Much Water We Can Use? \n\nTexas has 98 Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCD) located throughout the state to \nmanage groundwater use. We are within the Hays-Trinity district (HTGCD), and they are \nauthorized to establish groundwater consumption budgets for all non-exempt wells within their \ndistrict. A non-exempt well is a well capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons of \ngroundwater/day. These types of wells are subject to permitting and must comply with the \ndistrict\u2019s production fee schedule and orders. The La Ventana water allocation set by HTGCD is \njust under 40 million gallons per year (122 acre-feet), for all of our allowed 307 connections.. \nNote, that neither La Ventana nor any other neighborhood in the HTGCD has the ability or \npower to regulate, control, or enforce water consumption.  \n\nDuring this summer\u2019s severe drought, it was the HTGCD which was responsible for calling for an \nemergency stage (40% curtailment) district wide. Limiting groundwater use during drought is \nthe responsibility of groundwater conservation districts. Permit holders can be required to have \nplans to reduce demand during drought, but enforcement of the required reductions is \nchallenging. You may notice that a few other water companies in the area have called for less \nstrict drought restrictions than HTGCD has. This is because some areas (e.g., Dripping Springs \nand West Austin) get some of their water from Lake Travis via the Lower Colorado River \nAuthority.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done.

SWL uses Professional \nGeneral Management Services, Inc. (PGMS) as its water facility manager for the operating and \nadministrative services. Both SWL and PGMS are owned by the same individual\u2014Patric King. \nWe are not practicably able to change water companies.  \n\nWho Controls How Much Water We Can Use? \n\nTexas has 98 Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCD) located throughout the state to \nmanage groundwater use. We are within the Hays-Trinity district (HTGCD), and they are \nauthorized to establish groundwater consumption budgets for all non-exempt wells within their \ndistrict. A non-exempt well is a well capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons of \ngroundwater/day. These types of wells are subject to permitting and must comply with the \ndistrict\u2019s production fee schedule and orders. The La Ventana water allocation set by HTGCD is \njust under 40 million gallons per year (122 acre-feet), for all of our allowed 307 connections.. \nNote, that neither La Ventana nor any other neighborhood in the HTGCD has the ability or \npower to regulate, control, or enforce water consumption.  \n\nDuring this summer\u2019s severe drought, it was the HTGCD which was responsible for calling for an \nemergency stage (40% curtailment) district wide. Limiting groundwater use during drought is \nthe responsibility of groundwater conservation districts. Permit holders can be required to have \nplans to reduce demand during drought, but enforcement of the required reductions is \nchallenging. You may notice that a few other water companies in the area have called for less \nstrict drought restrictions than HTGCD has. This is because some areas (e.g., Dripping Springs \nand West Austin) get some of their water from Lake Travis via the Lower Colorado River \nAuthority.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

            "content": "which residents have asked lately.  \n\nWhere Do We Get Our Water? \n\nLa Ventana currently has 265homes and receives all of its water from three (3) deep water \nwells drilled within our neighborhood. All three wells pull groundwater from the Cow Creek \nFormation within the Middle Trinity Aquifer\u2014part of the Edwards-Trinity Aquifer. An aquifer is \nan underground layer of water-bearing, permeable rock, rock fractures, or unconsolidated \nmaterials. This aquifer is not small. The Trinity Aquifer system consumes some 21,308 square \nmiles of subsurface and extends across much of central and northeastern Texas. It consists of \nthree complexly interrelated aquifers-the Edwards-Trinity, the Edwards, and the Trinity \naquifers. They are stratigraphically equivalent in part and are hydraulically connected in some \nplaces. Most wells in Hays County pull water from the Cow Creek Formation, shown in the \nillustration below. The current three wells have the following historically demonstrated \nmaximum capacity:  Well #1: 70 gpm; Well #2: 50 gpm; Well #3: 30 gpm. However, the current \ncapacity of our three wells (assuming all wells are performing at peak capacity) is 150 gpm.  The \ncurrent actual capacity has been demonstrated in the 90-110 gpm range. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\nWho Supplies Our Water? \n\nTexas has 4,642 community water systems (CWS), of which 1,820 are privately-owned and \n4,308 serve populations of 10,000 or fewer. La Ventana\u2019s water needs are provided by such a \nprivately-owned utility called Southwest Liquids, Inc. (SWL).  On February 13, 2017, the Texas \nPublic Utility Commission (PUC) approved the sale and transfer of La Ventana, LLC, d/b/a/ La \nVentana Water Company\u2019s right to provide water to our neighborhood to SWL. SWL now holds \nCertificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN No. 12920)\u2014which gives it the exclusive right to \nprovide retail water utility service to the La Ventana neighborhood.

These changes aim to ensure that our neighborhood remains a desirable place to live, maintaining \nboth its aesthetics and property values. As most of you are aware, the CCR\u2019s are the tools used by your HOA Board \nto govern the use of a property in a community, and maintain consistency in property appearance, construction, \nmaintenance, etc. These rules exist to protect property values and maintain consistency in the community. CC&Rs \ncan include rules about, among other things: \n\n\u2022 Fences \n\u2022 Garbage cans Business openings\n\u2022 Maintaining animals, livestock, etc.\n\u2022 Unsightly or abandoned vehicles, trailers, etc., and\n\u2022 New construction of homes or improvements.\n\nBy updating the CCRs, the Board is given the tools necessary to preserve the integrity of La Ventana Ranch, \nprotecting property values and ensuring the long-term appeal of our neighborhood. These changes will help avoid \nsituations where neglected properties or unapproved modifications negatively impact surrounding homes. Our CCRs \nhave been in existence for many years and can be viewed on the website of PS Property Management, our new \nproperty management company. More information on these more global amendments will be forthcoming next year. \nIn the meantime, there is one amendment that will be necessary on a more urgent basis to address unclear language \nwithin the CCR\u2019s which may inadvertently allow Airbnb and Vrbo vacation home rentals to exist within the La Ventana \ncommunity.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

It is better to contact them than to begin a project without approval! \nThe application process is straightforward. Forms are available on the PS Management website under\nDocuments \u2192 Forms. Once you submit your application, the management company posts it, and then a\nmember of the AC will contact you to arrange a site visit. That visit to help clarify your plans and ensure they\nalign with the community\u2019s standards. After the review, you\u2019ll receive an email either granting approval or\nasking for adjustments. If your project changes partway through construction, it\u2019s important to resubmit\nthose changes for re-evaluation.\n\nWhile the CCRs and Bylaws give the committee the authority to enforce compliance, your AC doesn\u2019t see\nitself as the neighborhood police. We are here to help and guide you with not only understanding the CCRs,\nbut the functionality of your project, and perhaps provide historical information.  The members view their role\nas striking a balance between protecting individual homeowners\u2019 visions and ensuring that those visions don\u2019t\nundermine the look or value of the community as a whole. The AC exists to prevent those conflicts and\nmaintain fairness. \n\nAt the end of the day, the AC is one of those features of an HOA that may feel burdensome until you step\nback and see the bigger picture. By following the process, you not only stay in compliance with the CCRs, but\nyou also contribute to keeping La Ventana the unique, harmonious, and beautiful place we all call home. \n\nLa Ventana AC\n\nMona Jones- mkjones@me.com\nDave Blackwell- blave4152@att.net \nMiha Vindis- marquezvindis@gmail.com\nMicheal Estinopal- Michael.estinopal@gmail.com\n\nLa Ventana Architectural Committee\n\n\n\nLa Ventana\u2019s Water Story:\nWhy Distant Rains Matter\n\nBy Jack Jones & Gary Wickert\n\nWhen new residents move into La Ventana, one of the first questions they often ask is, \u201cWhere does our water",

The amended CCR section \nwould provide a defined length of time any single lot may be utilized for both short-term rentals (defined as six \n\nmonths to one year) and long-term rental (over one year). The Board feels that the new definition will help \n\nprevent the utilization of homes in la Ventana through Airbnb, VRBO, Vacasa, and other similar home rental \n\ncompanies. No rentals of less than six months will be allowed if this amendment passes. The current La Ventana \n\nDeclaration as well as the Texas Property Code \u00a7 209.0041 require that \"a declaration may be amended only by \n\na vote of 67 percent of the total votes allocated to property owners. Therefore, it is important that everybody \n\nvote and be heard on this issue. Please remind your friends and neighbors to also vote. \n\nThe La Ventana Board of Directors strongly urges you to vote for Option #1, in support of the Proposed \nAmendment (in green) below. \n\nCyrrent Section 3.41: \n\n3.41 Rentals. Nothing in this Declaration shall prevent the rental of an entire Lot and-the Improvements \nthereon by the Owner thereof for residential purposes, on either a short or long-term basis. In such event, \nboth Owner and tenant shall be responsible for compliance with this Declaration and all La Ventana Rules. \nNo Lot, including Improvements on a Lot, may be leased to more than four (4) adults at any one time. \n\n3.41 Rentals.",

To maintain the peace, security, and character of our neighborhood (not to mention the property values), the La Ventana HOA Board is proposing an important amendment to our Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs).\nWhy This Matters:\n\u2705 Preserve Neighborhood Peace & Safety \u2013 Short-term rentals bring a revolving door of strangers, increasing noise, parking issues, and security concerns.\n\u2705 Protect Property Values \u2013 Studies show that neighborhoods with excessive short-term rentals often see declining home values.\n\u2705 Maintain Our Community\u2019s Integrity \u2013 We are a residential community, not a vacation rental destination. Let\u2019s keep La Ventana a place where neighbors know and trust each other.\n\u2705 Prevent Amenity Misuse \u2013 Short-term guests have access to our community\u2019s gated entrance, pool, trails, and other amenities\u2014without the vested interest of a homeowner.\nA ballot will be sent to you via email and the voting will start in April. To pass this amendment, we need 67% of homeowners to vote in favor. This is not easy to accomplish and if we do not reach that benchmark, the proposed amendment will fail. Your vote is crucial!\n1 Vote per Lot (owners with multiple lots are weighted, no multiple votes per homeowner)\n\u2705 Vote YES to amend Article 3.41 and prohibit rentals of less than six months. Let\u2019s protect La Ventana together!\nQuestions? Contact PS Property Management at info@psprop.net.\nLa Ventana HOA Board of Directors\nimage1.png",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done.

Both SWL and PGMS are owned by the same individual\u2014Patric King. \nWe are not practicably able to change water companies.  \n\nWho Controls How Much Water We Can Use? \n\nTexas has 98 Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCD) located throughout the state to \nmanage groundwater use. We are within the Hays-Trinity district (HTGCD), and they are \nauthorized to establish groundwater consumption budgets for all non-exempt wells within their \ndistrict. A non-exempt well is a well capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons of \ngroundwater/day. These types of wells are subject to permitting and must comply with the \ndistrict\u2019s production fee schedule and orders. The La Ventana water allocation set by HTGCD is \njust under 40 million gallons per year (122 acre-feet), for all of our allowed 307 connections.. \nNote, that neither La Ventana nor any other neighborhood in the HTGCD has the ability or \npower to regulate, control, or enforce water consumption.  \n\nDuring this summer\u2019s severe drought, it was the HTGCD which was responsible for calling for an \nemergency stage (40% curtailment) district wide. Limiting groundwater use during drought is \nthe responsibility of groundwater conservation districts. Permit holders can be required to have \nplans to reduce demand during drought, but enforcement of the required reductions is \nchallenging. You may notice that a few other water companies in the area have called for less \nstrict drought restrictions than HTGCD has. This is because some areas (e.g., Dripping Springs \nand West Austin) get some of their water from Lake Travis via the Lower Colorado River \nAuthority.",

            "content": "which residents have asked lately.  \n\nWhere Do We Get Our Water? \n\nLa Ventana currently has 265homes and receives all of its water from three (3) deep water \nwells drilled within our neighborhood. All three wells pull groundwater from the Cow Creek \nFormation within the Middle Trinity Aquifer\u2014part of the Edwards-Trinity Aquifer. An aquifer is \nan underground layer of water-bearing, permeable rock, rock fractures, or unconsolidated \nmaterials. This aquifer is not small. The Trinity Aquifer system consumes some 21,308 square \nmiles of subsurface and extends across much of central and northeastern Texas. It consists of \nthree complexly interrelated aquifers-the Edwards-Trinity, the Edwards, and the Trinity \naquifers. They are stratigraphically equivalent in part and are hydraulically connected in some \nplaces. Most wells in Hays County pull water from the Cow Creek Formation, shown in the \nillustration below. The current three wells have the following historically demonstrated \nmaximum capacity:  Well #1: 70 gpm; Well #2: 50 gpm; Well #3: 30 gpm. However, the current \ncapacity of our three wells (assuming all wells are performing at peak capacity) is 150 gpm.  The \ncurrent actual capacity has been demonstrated in the 90-110 gpm range. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n\n\nWho Supplies Our Water? \n\nTexas has 4,642 community water systems (CWS), of which 1,820 are privately-owned and \n4,308 serve populations of 10,000 or fewer. La Ventana\u2019s water needs are provided by such a \nprivately-owned utility called Southwest Liquids, Inc. (SWL).  On February 13, 2017, the Texas \nPublic Utility Commission (PUC) approved the sale and transfer of La Ventana, LLC, d/b/a/ La \nVentana Water Company\u2019s right to provide water to our neighborhood to SWL. SWL now holds \nCertificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN No. 12920)\u2014which gives it the exclusive right to \nprovide retail water utility service to the La Ventana neighborhood.

The 2025 Annual Budget that was approved has a stated increase in the monthly assessment for each lot to $133 per month. \n\nThe LVROA assessment increase will go into effect on February 1, 2025. Please adjust any auto draft payments to reflect the updated amount due. The assessment is considered late after the 31st of each month. Please make sure your payments reflect the correct amount and due date to avoid any late fee penalties.\n\nPayments can be made online via your homeowner portal by login at https://owner.psprop.net/login. Online payments can be made for a fee utilizing a credit card or a single ACH e-check payment. To avoid a fee, you would need to set up recurring ACH e-check payments. You may also choose to make payments via US mail by mailing payments to: PS Property Management, 1490 Rusk Road, Ste. 301, Round Rock, TX 78665. Owners may submit payments in person at our South Austin location: 8701 Menchaca Road, Bldg. 2, Ste. 203, Austin, TX 78748.\n\nPlease contact PS Property Management, Inc. at (512) 251-6122 or by email at info@psprop.net with any questions or login issues.\n\n\nThank you.\nimage1.png",

            "content": "UNDERSTANDING THE WATER ISSUES AFFECTING LA VENTANA \n \n\nGary L. Wickert \n \nIt is often said that rumors are more exciting than the truth. That certainly seemed to be the \ncase this spring as my wife and I looked for a home in central Texas in order to be closer to two \nof our children and several grandchildren. La Ventana was high on our list, but we had heard \nfrom more than one source that the water supply to the neighborhood was rationed, very \nexpensive, and even running dry. I learned long ago never to rely on the tom-toms beating on \nthe street; so, I investigated. What I found convinced me that this was the place for us to live, \nand we moved last July, at the height of the 24th driest summer in the past 129 years. Having \ncome from rural Wisconsin\u2014a state boasting 15,000+ inland natural lakes and bordering 21% of \nthe Earth\u2019s surface fresh water\u2014we were strangers to water issues. Thankfully, we are most \nfortunate that our neighborhood Water Committee members resemble a Who\u2019s Who of \nexperts on the subject. They answered a lot of my questions and are available to answer yours \nas well.  \n \nThe first thing I learned was that neither La Ventana nor the wells from which we get our fresh \nwater was going to run out of water. The issues we face have more to do with maintaining our \nwater system infrastructure and compelling our water utility to comply with orders previously \nissued by the state of Texas. A thorough dissertation on water utilities and hydrogeology would \nbe neither practical nor helpful here. La Ventana is home to some of the most experienced \ngeologists and hydrogeologists I have ever known, and the La Ventana Ranch Owners\u2019 \nAssociation (LVROA) board felt it would be helpful if we would publicly answer several \nquestions which residents have asked lately.  \n\nWhere Do We Get Our Water? \n\nLa Ventana currently has 265homes and receives all of its water from three (3) deep water \nwells drilled within our neighborhood.",

SWL uses Professional \nGeneral Management Services, Inc. (PGMS) as its water facility manager for the operating and \nadministrative services. Both SWL and PGMS are owned by the same individual\u2014Patric King. \nWe are not practicably able to change water companies.  \n\nWho Controls How Much Water We Can Use? \n\nTexas has 98 Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCD) located throughout the state to \nmanage groundwater use. We are within the Hays-Trinity district (HTGCD), and they are \nauthorized to establish groundwater consumption budgets for all non-exempt wells within their \ndistrict. A non-exempt well is a well capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons of \ngroundwater/day. These types of wells are subject to permitting and must comply with the \ndistrict\u2019s production fee schedule and orders. The La Ventana water allocation set by HTGCD is \njust under 40 million gallons per year (122 acre-feet), for all of our allowed 307 connections.. \nNote, that neither La Ventana nor any other neighborhood in the HTGCD has the ability or \npower to regulate, control, or enforce water consumption.  \n\nDuring this summer\u2019s severe drought, it was the HTGCD which was responsible for calling for an \nemergency stage (40% curtailment) district wide. Limiting groundwater use during drought is \nthe responsibility of groundwater conservation districts. Permit holders can be required to have \nplans to reduce demand during drought, but enforcement of the required reductions is \nchallenging. You may notice that a few other water companies in the area have called for less \nstrict drought restrictions than HTGCD has. This is because some areas (e.g., Dripping Springs \nand West Austin) get some of their water from Lake Travis via the Lower Colorado River \nAuthority.",

            "content": "much is currently happening in this claim right now, but we have a mediation \nscheduled for next March and hope to work things out then.  \n\nWhat About Residents Who Consume Large Amounts of Water? \n\nGood conservation measures mean that all residents should comply with reasonable \nrestrictions.  Neither La Ventana nor its Board have any power or authority to compel LVROA \nresidents to comply with recommended water restrictions or comply with drought mandates. In \nthe PUC orders mentioned above, SWL was required to communicate with \u201chigh consuming\u201d \ncustomers to encourage more reasonable consumption practices. They had not been doing this. \nMore recently, \u201chigh consuming\u201d residents have been receiving letters advising that if they do \nnot cut their consumption, SWL would install a meter flow restrictor on their water meter.  \n  \n\n\n\nShould La Ventana Purchase Southwest Liquids?  \n\nThere has been some discussion of La Ventana purchasing SWL and operating it ourselves. This \npossibility is less expensive than it sounds but is fraught with an entirely new set of problems, \nexpenses, and responsibilities. Without making public information and ideas which may give \nSWL a negotiating advantage should we ever decide to go this route, suffice it to say that there \nis general consensus on the Board and among our residents that we should not pursue this \nstrategy. In many ways, if we operated our own water utility, we might be able to more adroitly \nhandle many of the maintenance, water supply, water quality, and infrastructure concerns. But \nwe are not in the business of owning and operating utilities\u2014we are a residential \nneighborhood. Purchasing SWL costs money and your board is simultaneously committed to \nthe excellence of our services, amenities, and infrastructure, and saving money.  \n\nWe should also be aware that there is a good possibility that SWL sells the water company to \nanother Investor-Owned Utility such as Aqua Texas.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done.

If the Olivettis\nwant to work out who pays what portion of the payment plan that\u2019s between them.\n \nPlease let me know if the Board would like to respond to Mr. Garza\u2019s communication prior to us\ncontacting the Olivett\u2019s to arrange the joint payment plan.\n \nHave a fantastic day!\n \nRegards,\n\u00a0\nDana\u00a0Fenner\nParalegal\n\nmailto:amy@psprop.net\nmailto:mce58@protonmail.com\nhttps://psprop.net/\nhttp://512-399-4616/\nhttps://www.psprop.net/\nmailto:invoices@psprop.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect: 737-261-0624\ndana.fenner@caglepugh.com\nwww.caglepugh.com\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n \nAustin\u00a0|  4301 Westbank Dr., Bldg.",
