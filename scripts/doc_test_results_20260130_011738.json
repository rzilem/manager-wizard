We've\nincluded a detailed estimate of your project along with as many details as possilble\n\nIf you have any questions about our bid, material, service, pricing or any other question,\nplease don't hesitate to call. We have many price points that fits most budgets. \n\nWe've been building all types of fences since 2006. We build residential & commercial, wood\nprivacy of just about any style, ornamental iron, chainlink, custom gates, gate operators\ninstallation, decks & pergolas. We always use screws as fasteners not nails.

Portions of Highpointe are located in areas with sensitive \nenvironmental features. Accordingly, there are limitations, including impervious cover \nrestrictions, on development activity in the subdivision. The recorded plats for the subdivision \nare accessible at the following link: https://hayscad.com/subdivisionplats/sublisth/. The plats \ncontain information about setbacks, greenbelt lots, and use restrictions. The plats should be \nreviewed along with the recorded governing documents for Highpointe. \n\nUse of Adjacent Lots. As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review. With few exceptions, improvements must be approved by the Association \nin writing before work commences. When in doubt, please inquire by contacting the Association. \nIt is NOT better to ask for forgiveness then permission where approval is concerned. The \ngoverning documents, including the Design Guidelines, contain additional rules pertaining to \nuse of the greenbelt and open space lots, as well as the Highpointe trail system. \n\nDefinitions \n\n\"Common Area\" means any property and facilities that the Association owns or in which it",

Portions of Highpointe are located in areas with sensitive \nenvironmental features. Accordingly, there are limitations, including impervious cover \nrestrictions, on development activity in the subdivision. The recorded plats for the subdivision \nare accessible at the following link: https://hayscad.com/subdivisionplats/sublisth/. The plats \ncontain information about setbacks, greenbelt lots, and use restrictions. The plats should be \nreviewed along with the recorded governing documents for Highpointe. \n\nUse of Adjacent Lots. As a general rule, property that is adjacent to your lot that you do not own \nmay not be used as an extension of your property. \n\nMaintaining Adjacent Lots. If your rear property line is adjacent to a greenbelt lot owned by the \nAssociation, in most cases you have the right to weed eat the property to a distance of up to 20 \nfeet beyond your rear fence and you may remove small brush and dead cedar trees. All debris, \nbranches, leaves, and clippings must be removed from the property. \n\nArchitectural Review. With few exceptions, improvements must be approved by the Association \nin writing before work commences. When in doubt, please inquire by contacting the Association. \nIt is NOT better to ask for forgiveness then permission where approval is concerned. The \ngoverning documents, including the Design Guidelines, contain additional rules pertaining to \nuse of the greenbelt and open space lots, as well as the Highpointe trail system. \n\nDefinitions \n\n\"Common Area\" means any property and facilities that the Association owns or in which it",

The   \nproblem   is   that   we   have   two   residents,   using   these   spots   for   storage   of   vehicles   that   never   \nmove.    Which   is   not   fair,   rude   and   quite   frankly   making   our   area   look   like   a   parking   lot.    If   I   get   \nhome   late   and   all   spots   are   taken-   no   problem-   that   is   on   me.    Cars   should   be   coming   and   going   \nfrom   these   spots   on   a   daily,   maybe   even   weekly   basis.    But   these   cars   are   not.    Over   a   year   \nago,   we   had   a   similar   situation   with   one   of   my   neighbors,   that   I   did   not   bring   up,   but   someone   \nelse   did.    It   was   a   large   purple   truck   that   they   had   sitting   in   a   visitor   spot   for   months   on   end.    PS   \nproperty   management   did   step   in   and   remove   that   car.    Why   are   we   not   doing   the   same   here?   \nIs   it   because   board   members   listed   on   this   letter   are   friends   with   the   addresses   in   violation?    Are   \nwe   protecting   our   \u201cbuddies\u201d?    If   the   policy   has   changed,   I   have   yet   to   see   an   update   be   sent   to   \nme,   did   I   miss   something?    We   pay   a   lot   of   money   to   live   here,   at   what   point   is   the   \u201cparking   lot\u201d   \n\u201cdump   you   old   car\u201d   look   going   to   stop?    Lastly,   please   note,   this   is   not   about   me.    I   have   had   up   \nto   4   cars   under   my   ownership   while   living   here   and   guess   what-   they   all   fit   in   my   garage   or   \ndriveway.    I   do   not   need   the   guest\\visitor   parking   spot,   but   do   you   know   who   does?    My   70ish  \nyear   old   neighbors   who   have   friends   over   weekly   for   bridge.

PO Box 7079 Round Rock, Texas 78683\n\n\n\n\nDecember 11, 2024 Spicewood Point Owners,\nRecently, the repair/replacement of patio fences was identified as the responsibility of the unit owner. Estimated cost is between $1500.00 to $2600.00 per unit and there are 26units that have patio fencing.\nThere have been some questions on having the HOA continue past practice of paying for patio fence repair/replacement. In order for the HOA to pay for patio fencing, a special assessment would be necessary (this expense is not budgeted and would be a significant and unwise drain on reserve funds). A special assessment requires 2/3 of the owners to approve. Based on estimates obtained, the cost of replacing patio fences for the 26 units would be approximately $39,000 to $67,000. This would equate to approximately $1000.00 to $1289.00 per unit (53 units).\nAssessments are based on square feet per unit, so exact amounts per unit would vary.\nWe (the HOA board members) are asking each owner to vote on whether a special assessment should be imposed for patio fence replacement. If passed, then payment in full would be due within 30 days of the special assessment passing. If it fails to pass, then the HOA will not pay for patio fence repair/replacement.\nYou will be notified via email and regular mail on the voting process. Thank you for your attention to thismatter.\nHOA Board\nCindy Williams, Stephen Phister, Judith Kaplan\n\nSpicewood Point Townhome Owners Association, Inc.\nc/o PS Property Management Co., Inc.

Texting Assistant)\ninfo@psprop.net\n\nSpicewood Point Townhome Owners Association, Inc. \nc/o PS Property Management Co., Inc. \n\n PO Box 7079 Round Rock, Texas 78683 \n\nDecember 11, 2024 \n\nSpicewood Point Owners, \n\nRecently, the repair/replacement of patio fences was identified as the responsibility of \nthe unit owner. Estimated cost is between $1500.00 to $2600.00 per unit and there \nare 26 units that have patio fencing. \n\nThere have been some questions on having the HOA continue past practice of \npaying for patio fence repair/replacement. In order for the HOA to pay for patio \nfencing, a special assessment would be necessary (this expense is not budgeted and \nwould be a significant and unwise drain on reserve funds). A special assessment \nrequires 2/3 of the owners to approve. Based on estimates obtained, the cost of \nreplacing patio fences for the 26 units would be approximately $39,000 to $67,600. \nThis would equate to approximately $736.00 to $1276.00 per unit (53 units). \nAssessments are based on square feet per unit, so exact amounts per unit would vary. \n\nWe (the HOA board members) are asking each owner to vote on whether a special \nassessment should be imposed for patio fence replacement. If passed, then payment \nin full would be due within 30 days of the special assessment passing. If it fails to \npass, then the HOA will not pay for patio fence repair/replacement. \n\nYou will be notified via email and regular mail on the voting process. Thank \n\nyou for your attention to this matter. \n\nHOA Board \n\nCindy Williams, Stephen Phister, Judith Kaplan \n\ntel:512-251-6122\nhttp://512-399-4616/\nmailto:info@psprop.net\n\n\nSpicewood Point Townhome Owners Association, Inc. \nc/o PS Property Management Co., Inc. \n\nPO Box 7079; Round Rock, Texas 78683 \nPhone: 512-251-6122 \u25cf E-mail: INFO@psprop.net \n\nwww.psprop.net \n\n \n\n\u25a1 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n2023 Vote to replace Patio fences.",

I   now   have   to   take   matters   into   my   own   hands.   \nI   don't   even   know   who   the   3   of   you   are,   other   than   via   a   zoom   meeting   once   a   year,   which   is   \nfine,   so   please   do   not   take   this   personally   in   any   way.    I   have   lived   here   since   day   1,   follow   the   \nrules,   don't   cause   any   issues   and   pay   my   bills-   on   time.

The Enclave at FC internet portal needs to be updated with posting the annual report \nfor previous years. \n\ne. There were a number of concerns raised about the workmanship of the landscape \ncrew from Lomas Landscape. It was agreed that John Marshall would contact the \nowner to schedule a walk through the neighborhood to review the concerns. \n\nf. The question was raised about an audit of the financial reports for our HOA. The \nmanager will look into the cost of an audit as well as the cost of a \u201creview.\u201d It was \n\n\n\nagreed to ask one of the residents if they would volunteer to quarterly review the \nfinancials. \n\ng. When the perimeter fence along Forest Creek Drive was repaired, it was believed \nthat they were to caulk both the exterior and interior of the fence. Some homes did \nnot get repaired on the inside. It is necessary to review the contract and follow up \nwith the inside repairs. \n\nh. Forest Creek HOA has a number of FenceCrete slats. It was agreed to contact the \nHOA and determine how we might secure the slats for deteriorating sections of \nEnclave fencing. \n\ni. The large oak tree at 5025 seems to be diseased or dying. The homeowner rents the \nproperty. Since the tree is so large, it was agreed to contact the owner and ask about \nthe tree. \n\nj. There was a discussion about the front entrance inside the gate. Several residents \nvolunteered to address the landscape needs of this area. We also need to paint the \nwrought iron fencing and replace the \u201cnot responsible\u201d signs. \n\nk. There was a discussion about homeowners wanting to install solar panels. The state \nof Texas prohibits HOA\u2019s from rejecting the use of solar panels but may be able to \nestablish a set of standards. The manager will research other Texas HOA\u2019s response \nto solar panel installation requests. \n\n7. It was moved and seconded, all agreed to adjourn the meeting at 7:26 pm",

President John Marshall called the meeting to order at 6:30 pm.  \n2. It was determined by the property manager that we had a quorum of 27 owners \n\nattending in person, via Zoom and by proxy. \n3. The Annual Meeting Minutes of 2021 were approved as amended. \n4. The property manager reviewed the 2022 Financial report, responding to questions \n\nabout the fence repair invoice from January 2021. \n5. There was one position open on the board. Bill Ciarfella agreed to run for that position. \n\nThere were no nominations from the floor. It was moved and seconded and all approved \nto accept Bill\u2019s nomination by acclamation. Of note, the board had voted not to replace \nposition number six on the board, making it a five-member board. The members are: \nJohn Marshall, Bill Ciarfella, Melanie Harris, Dan Champion and Charlene O\u2019Connell. \nThe Board will convene to determine the officers. \n\n6. Homeowners\u2019 concerns  \na. Gate openers\u2014a number of residents have experienced intermittent working of the \n\npresent gate openers. New openers are on order.  \nb. The homeowner at 5027 rents the property. The homeowner made landscape \n\nimprovements but they are unfinished, especially a section in the front yard that is \ndeveloping weeds.  \n\nc. Forest Creek HOA made landscape improvements along Forest Creek Dr. Large \nsections along the Enclave properties contain mulch where it is difficult for the \ngrass to grow. However, those areas are being watered. Is there a way to control \nthis watering so prevent unnecessary expense? \n\nd. The Enclave at FC internet portal needs to be updated with posting the annual report \nfor previous years. \n\ne.",

President John Marshall called the meeting to order at 6:30 pm.  \n2. It was determined by the property manager that we had a quorum of 27 owners \n\nattending in person, via Zoom and by proxy. \n3. The Annual Meeting Minutes of 2021 were approved as amended. \n4. The property manager reviewed the 2022 Financial report, responding to questions \n\nabout the fence repair invoice from January 2021. \n5. There was one position open on the board. Bill Ciarfella agreed to run for that position. \n\nThere were no nominations from the floor. It was moved and seconded and all approved \nto accept Bill\u2019s nomination by acclamation. Of note, the board had voted not to replace \nposition number six on the board, making it a five-member board. The members are: \nJohn Marshall, Bill Ciarfella, Melanie Harris, Dan Champion and Charlene O\u2019Connell. \nThe Board will convene to determine the officers. \n\n6. Homeowners\u2019 concerns  \na. Gate openers\u2014a number of residents have experienced intermittent working of the \n\npresent gate openers. New openers are on order.  \nb. The homeowner at 5027 rents the property. The homeowner made landscape \n\nimprovements but they are unfinished, especially a section in the front yard that is \ndeveloping weeds.  \n\nc. Forest Creek HOA made landscape improvements along Forest Creek Dr. Large \nsections along the Enclave properties contain mulch where it is difficult for the \ngrass to grow. However, those areas are being watered. Is there a way to control \nthis watering so prevent unnecessary expense? \n\nd. The Enclave at FC internet portal needs to be updated with posting the annual report \nfor previous years. \n\ne.",

The property manager reviewed the 2022 Financial report, responding to questions \n\nabout the fence repair invoice from January 2021. \n5. There was one position open on the board. Bill Ciarfella agreed to run for that position. \n\nThere were no nominations from the floor. It was moved and seconded and all approved \nto accept Bill\u2019s nomination by acclamation. Of note, the board had voted not to replace \nposition number six on the board, making it a five-member board. The members are: \nJohn Marshall, Bill Ciarfella, Melanie Harris, Dan Champion and Charlene O\u2019Connell. \nThe Board will convene to determine the officers. \n\n6. Homeowners\u2019 concerns  \na. Gate openers\u2014a number of residents have experienced intermittent working of the \n\npresent gate openers. New openers are on order.  \nb. The homeowner at 5027 rents the property. The homeowner made landscape \n\nimprovements but they are unfinished, especially a section in the front yard that is \ndeveloping weeds.  \n\nc. Forest Creek HOA made landscape improvements along Forest Creek Dr. Large \nsections along the Enclave properties contain mulch where it is difficult for the \ngrass to grow. However, those areas are being watered. Is there a way to control \nthis watering so prevent unnecessary expense? \n\nd. The Enclave at FC internet portal needs to be updated with posting the annual report \nfor previous years. \n\ne.",

Some guards have left because of \nthis treatment and some security personnel are choosing not to work here because of some \nresidents behavior.  \n \nIn the event of abuse of the guards by a resident, the POA Board has taken the following \nactions : \n \n\n1. The new RFID Agreement requires a signature for purchasers of RFID tags. It states: \n \n\nRequires a Resident, Resident\u2019s family, and invitees and/or contractors to at all times \ntreat the security personnel hired by the POA and all representatives of the POA in a \ncourteous and respectful manner.

Some guards have left because of \nthis treatment and some security personnel are choosing not to work here because of some \nresidents behavior.  \n \nIn the event of abuse of the guards by a resident, the POA Board has taken the following \nactions : \n \n\n1. The new RFID Agreement requires a signature for purchasers of RFID tags. It states: \n \n\nRequires a Resident, Resident\u2019s family, and invitees and/or contractors to at all times \ntreat the security personnel hired by the POA and all representatives of the POA in a \ncourteous and respectful manner. Failure to do so shall result in disabling of the \nRFID tag without notice.\u201d \n\n \n2.

If repeated violations are observed, all \nRFID privileges will be suspended indefinitely.

These changes aim to ensure that our neighborhood remains a desirable place to live, maintaining \nboth its aesthetics and property values. As most of you are aware, the CCR\u2019s are the tools used by your HOA Board \nto govern the use of a property in a community, and maintain consistency in property appearance, construction, \nmaintenance, etc. These rules exist to protect property values and maintain consistency in the community. CC&Rs \ncan include rules about, among other things: \n\n\u2022 Fences \n\u2022 Garbage cans Business openings\n\u2022 Maintaining animals, livestock, etc.\n\u2022 Unsightly or abandoned vehicles, trailers, etc., and\n\u2022 New construction of homes or improvements.\n\nBy updating the CCRs, the Board is given the tools necessary to preserve the integrity of La Ventana Ranch, \nprotecting property values and ensuring the long-term appeal of our neighborhood. These changes will help avoid \nsituations where neglected properties or unapproved modifications negatively impact surrounding homes. Our CCRs \nhave been in existence for many years and can be viewed on the website of PS Property Management, our new \nproperty management company. More information on these more global amendments will be forthcoming next year. \nIn the meantime, there is one amendment that will be necessary on a more urgent basis to address unclear language \nwithin the CCR\u2019s which may inadvertently allow Airbnb and Vrbo vacation home rentals to exist within the La Ventana \ncommunity.",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

We responded to Cagle Pugh and told\nthem they would need to track the payments for the past due portion from Mr. Olivetti.\n \nPerhaps Cagle Pugh can draft the payment plan and act on collection enforcement should the\nowners fail to make timely payments. Should Mrs. Olivetti be able to present a divorce decree\nthat shows Mr. Olivetti is responsible for arrears - that helps her in court should he not pay.\nShould Mr. Olivetti not pay the arrears \u2013 the enforcement would be through the HOA collection\nattorney and her divorce attorney to help enforce.\n \nMy opinion \u2013 this is not the HOA\u2019s problem. Mr. Olivetti needs to pay the back balance in full\nand we are done. He can carry a loan or credit card balance to pay off the balance due to the\nHOA \u2013 not La Ventana incur additional attorney fees to track his past due debt.\n \nThank\u00a0you,\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAmy\u00a0Loughrey\nCommunity\u00a0Manager\n\n\u00a0(512)\u00a0251\u20116122\n(512)\u00a0399\u20114616\u00a0(A.I.\u00a0Texting\u00a0Assistant)\n\u00a0www.psprop.net\n\nPlease\u00a0send\u00a0all\u00a0vendor\u00a0invoices\u00a0to\u00a0invoices@psprop.net.\n \nFrom: mce58@protonmail.com <mce58@protonmail.com> \nSent: Monday, October 28, 2024 5:31 PM\nTo: Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net>\nSubject: Re: La Ventana Ranch: Olivetti- 2516 La Ventana Pkwy [Firm-003884-000002]\n \nAmy, r y\u2019all able to set up two accounts,one fir Mr Olivetti and one for Mrs. I would assume  she\nalready has one for dues\n \nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\n \n \nOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 12:48 PM, Amy Loughrey <amy@psprop.net> wrote:\n\nHi everyone and Happy Monday!\n \nI know that with all the excitement from the recent board election that perhaps the",

            "content": "LA VENTANA\u2019S ARCHITECTURAL COMMITTEE \nThe Architectural Committee (AC) is a necessary fixture of neighborhood life. In La Ventana, the AC is made of volunteers who are appointed by the Board. They knowingly take on the role of reviewing, approving, and sometimes denying projects that affect the look and feel of our community, or which otherwise do not comply with the rules we all agreed to live by.  The work they do is central to keeping La Ventana beautiful, cohesive, and consistent with the standards outlined in our CCRs and Bylaws.\nThe AC\u2019s responsibility extends beyond new home construction. They also review applications for a wide range of projects: roofs, pools, patios, garages, casitas, driveways, sheds, rainwater tanks, and fencing, to name a few. They keep an eye on smaller improvements too, such as outdoor lighting, flagpoles, playscapes, treehouses, porches, decks, mailboxes, landscaping, walkways, screening walls, satellite dishes, generators, and solar panels.  If you are unsure whether your project requires an application, please consult with any member of the AC. It is better to contact them than to begin a project without approval! \nThe application process is straightforward. Forms are available on the PS Management website under Documents \u2192 Forms. Once you submit your application, the management company posts it, and then a member of the AC will contact you to arrange a site visit. That visit to help clarify your plans and ensure they align with the community\u2019s standards. After the review, you\u2019ll receive an email either granting approval or asking for adjustments. If your project changes partway through construction, it\u2019s important to resubmit those changes for re-evaluation.\nWhile the CCRs and Bylaws give the committee the authority to enforce compliance, your AC doesn\u2019t see itself as the neighborhood police.",

In La Ventana, the AC is made of volunteers who are appointed by the Board. They knowingly take on the role of reviewing, approving, and sometimes denying projects that affect the look and feel of our community, or which otherwise do not comply with the rules we all agreed to live by.  The work they do is central to keeping La Ventana beautiful, cohesive, and consistent with the standards outlined in our CCRs and Bylaws.\nThe AC\u2019s responsibility extends beyond new home construction. They also review applications for a wide range of projects: roofs, pools, patios, garages, casitas, driveways, sheds, rainwater tanks, and fencing, to name a few. They keep an eye on smaller improvements too, such as outdoor lighting, flagpoles, playscapes, treehouses, porches, decks, mailboxes, landscaping, walkways, screening walls, satellite dishes, generators, and solar panels.  If you are unsure whether your project requires an application, please consult with any member of the AC. It is better to contact them than to begin a project without approval! \nThe application process is straightforward. Forms are available on the PS Management website under Documents \u2192 Forms. Once you submit your application, the management company posts it, and then a member of the AC will contact you to arrange a site visit. That visit to help clarify your plans and ensure they align with the community\u2019s standards. After the review, you\u2019ll receive an email either granting approval or asking for adjustments. If your project changes partway through construction, it\u2019s important to resubmit those changes for re-evaluation.\nWhile the CCRs and Bylaws give the committee the authority to enforce compliance, your AC doesn\u2019t see itself as the neighborhood police.",

This is because some areas (e.g., Dripping Springs \nand West Austin) get some of their water from Lake Travis via the Lower Colorado River \nAuthority.  \n\nCan LVROA Punish or Fine Water Overuse Within La Ventana? \n\nLVROA generally does not have the authority to penalize water overuse. This is a matter \nbetween SWL and the individual customers. An exception is in the Deed Covenants, Conditions, \nand Restrictions for the Preserve/Phase 3 which have some restrictions on outside water.  \nViolations there can be subject to the LVROA fine structure. Even the HTGCD does not have the \nauthority to restrict or regulate \u201cexempt wells\u201d (wells which produce no more than 25,000 \ngallons per day). This is a matter of state law because current state statutes do not grant \nHTGCD the authority to permit and regulate an exempt well. The state legislature would have \nto address disparity.  \n\nWhat is a Reasonable Amount of Water Consumption for a Household?  \n\n\n\nOur current average is about 350 gallons/day/connection (10,646 gal/mo.).  However, we have \nbeen operating under an emergency stage 4 curtailment at a 40% reduction of this baseline \nsince August 2022\u2014reducing it to 210 gal/day or 6,400 gal/mo. The water budget from HTGCD \nis based on state and national averages and recommendations.  These guidelines are declining \nover time to reflect the new normal for drought, as well as recognition for the modern water \nsaving water fixtures we love so much. The latest projections suggest a per-capita consumption \nof about 70 gal/day, that is 150 \u2013 200 gal/day for a 2\u20133-person household. Historically, La \nVentana has used slightly more than our neighbors\u2014366 gal/day vs. 226 gal/day for the \naverage of the other top 15 water companies.  However, since 2022, when we have been under \ndrought restrictions, our average has decreased into the low 300\u2019s \u2013 in line with the reduced \nallocations.",

            "content": "will be necessary on a more urgent basis to address unclear language \nwithin the CCR\u2019s which may inadvertently allow Airbnb and Vrbo vacation home rentals to exist within the La Ventana \ncommunity. In our board\u2019s discussion with residents, almost without exception (the exceptions being those renting \nout their homes for a weekend), these \u201cAirbnb rentals\u201d over the weekend are strongly objected to.\n\n Our community has long been valued for its quiet, peaceful atmosphere, which is why many of us chose to live here. \nHowever, with the rise of short-term rental platforms like Vrbo and Airbnb, there\u2019s been an influx of weekend \nvacationers and partygoers that can disrupt the tranquility we cherish. While these services weren\u2019t around when our \nCCRs were originally drafted, we now face the need to clarify rental guidelines to preserve the integrity of our \nneighborhood. Currently, Section 3.41 of the CCRs allows for home rentals but does not define what constitutes \n\"short-term.\" To address this, we propose amending the CCRs to define \"short-term rental\" as a minimum of six \nmonths to a year, and \"long-term rental\" as anything over a year. This change would ensure that homeowners can \nstill rent their properties, but it would effectively prohibit transient vacationers from using homes as weekend \ngetaways, which include partying outside in a pool, loud barbecues until late in the night, driving fast on our roads, \nand a general disruption of the community's quiet environment. La Ventana is not a resort for weekend warriors\u2014it\u2019s \nhome.  \n\nBy adding this simple clarification, we can maintain the peaceful atmosphere that attracted all of us to this \nneighborhood in the first place, while still allowing responsible, long-term rentals. Your support in amending the \nCCRs is crucial to keeping our community the peaceful, residential haven we all enjoy. Your participation in this",

One unit is scheduled because of an error with the plumber, 2 units have been unable to be entered so status is unknown.\n\u00b7 Dryer Vent Cleaning- Brenda updated the community on the dryer vent cleaning. Many participated and it was a success.\n\u00b7 Front and Rear Gate Repair- Matt did the welding and cleaning at the gates. Texas Central Access Control did the initial repair on the actual motor and will come out to replace the box around the cap XL system as soon as Matt puts the poles around the system for protection.\n\u00b7 Palm Tree Replacement at Pool- This turned out to be a significant cost to replace the palm at the same size. We will be reviewing options.\n\u00b7 Parking Review- Ann discussed the changes with the parking so we can accommodate more guest parking spots.\n\nNew Business:\n\u00b7 Recycle Bin Vandalism - Camera Installation \u2013 a new camera was installed around the dumpster and recycling bins.  We will be fining anyone who misuses or vandalizes the dumpster or bins.\n\u00b7 Improvement Projects- The board discussed the projects that they will be working on going forward. Landscaping is a priority, painting of the doors/garage doors.\n\u00b7 Insurance Renewal- Gated Texas talked about the insurance renewal.  We were able to get renewed with our current insurance company, but we did change brokers.  There was a significant increase in premium due to the freeze. When the policy was shopped around, we found that many companies would not bid on the property for various reasons.  One being the amount of roofline, another that companies do not want to take on condominium units.\n\u00b7",
