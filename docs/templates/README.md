## How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Copy the Template
Copy the markdown template to create a community-specific version.

### Step 2: Replace Placeholders
Replace all bracketed placeholders with community-specific information:
- `[COMMUNITY NAME]` - Full community name
- `[DATE]` - Effective date
- `[AMOUNT]` - Fee amounts
- `[PORTAL URL]` - Community portal URL
- etc.

### Step 3: Customize Sections
Remove or modify sections that don't apply to the specific community:
- Some communities may not have pools
- Some may not have rental restrictions
- Gate-related sections only for gated communities

### Step 4: Save as PDF
Convert to PDF with community branding:
- Suggested filename: `[Community Name] - [Policy Type].pdf`
- Example: `Falcon Pointe - Pet Policy.pdf`

### Step 5: Upload to SharePoint
Upload to the appropriate community folder in SharePoint:
```
AssociationDocs/
  └── [Community Name]/
      └── Public/
          └── Rules and Guidelines/
              └── [Document].pdf
```

### Step 6: Verify Indexing
Wait for Azure AI Search indexer to pick up the new document (runs [schedule]), then test the query in Manager Wizard.
